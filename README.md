# Flowers for Life

Flowers for Life is a CLI data automation program designed for the inventory management of flowers in a florist shop. 

User can acknowledge current stock of flowers and accordingly add or deduct plants in or from the current stocks as sold, used or bought. User can additionally remove an existing plant in the current stock that is no more seasonal and instead input a new plant that is available during the season, in its respective category.

This python programme runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

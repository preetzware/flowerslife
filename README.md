# Flowers for Life

Flowers for Life is a CLI data automation program designed for the inventory management of flowers in a florist shop. 

User can acknowledge current stock of flowers and accordingly add or deduct plants in or from the current stocks as sold, used or bought. User can additionally remove an existing plant in the current stock that is no more seasonal and instead input a new plant that is available during the season, in its respective category.

This python programme runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

## Project Goals

The main purpose of Flowers for Life is to provide a timely stock management system for the plants in the florist business context. It combines various vital elements, including adding stock as bought, deducting stock as used in arrangements, sold individually or damaged, and updating the stock by adding new seasonal plants into their respective categories or deleting an existing plant name from the system that is out of season.
